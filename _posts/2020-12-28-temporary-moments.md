This project is a collection of photos of public art and community voices. Currently, this timeline tracks Seattle, WA from the stay at home order through the racial justice protests in 2020. I would like to expand this project to include public art from around the world.

#### The importance of public art
Public art adds cultural and aesthetic values to our community. It contributes to a community’s identity, it fosters community pride and a sense of belonging. It is freely accessible and is interspersed within our everyday environment. This accessibility highlights that this art is for everyone to see and isn’t gated. 

#### How this all started
In the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 thrusted the world into panic and quarantine. My friend Angela and I would take walks for our well being and to exercise. Seattle was quiet. Even Pike Place was empty. In these walks, we saw boarded up businesses with kind words and affirmations. We noticed and began taking photos.
