Hello! Iâ€™m Ellen. Currently, I am transitioning into my next chapter. I am interested in the intersection of art, engineering, and social justice. 

I received my education at the University of Pennsylvania with a Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technologies and a Bachelors of Engineering and Science in Digital Media Design in May 2018. There, I studied computer programming, mathematics, and design behind computer graphics, animation, games, virtual reality environments, and interactive technologies.
